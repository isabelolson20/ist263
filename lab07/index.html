            <h1>Isabel Olson's Biography</h1>
             <p>My name is Izzy Olson and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying Public Relations at the Newhouse School of Communications. At first, I was looking into studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism, but I finalized my decision at the end of my freshman year to pursue Public Relations. I’m interested in the consumer or fashion related area of Public Relations.</p>
             <p> Outside of school, I do acrylic paintings and sell them to friends. I also sell sweatshirts that I design (I bleach dye them and iron on patches). My favorite tv shows are Breaking Bad, That 70s Show, and Criminal Minds. Some other hobbies I enjoy are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>kick-boxing</li>
                <li>volunteering at my favorite non-profit, Family Promise</li>
                <li>hanging out with my friends</li>
            </ul>    
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
             <p>I have two brothers, one older and one younger, and my mom and dad who share the same birthday. My older brother is a senior at Dartmouth College, and my younger brother is a sophomore in high school. Additionally, I have two Portuguese Water Dogs, like Obama’s dogs.</p>         </body>
